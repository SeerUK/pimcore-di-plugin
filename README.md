Pimcore Dependency Injection Plugin
===================================
 
## Installation

Create simply install the plugin. This should create a folder under the Pimcore website directory
called config (if it doesn't already exist), and create a `container.php` file. From there, just use
[PHP-DI](http://php-di.org/doc/) as normal!
